# About Me  
## Charles Sambo  

Hello! I’m Charles Sambo — Cloud Engineer at Azure, DevOps enthusiast, data-platform tinkerer, and author at [cloudworrior.com](https://www.cloudworrior.com). 

With a passion for building reliable, scalable infrastructure and solving real business challenges, I’ve spent my career doing things like:

- Designing and implementing **cloud platforms**, leveraging Azure services for performance and cost-efficiency  
- Automating operations and deployments via CI/CD, Kubernetes, containerization and infrastructure as code  
- Developing data backends and analytics workflows to turn raw data into insights  

This 11-day PostgreSQL learning programme is the latest project under my belt — a full end-to-end developer/data-engineer portfolio covering everything from SQL basics to advanced production-grade database engineering.  

### 🔧 Why I Created This Course  
I believe that today’s developers and data engineers need more than just “I can run a SELECT statement.” They need to *design*, *optimize*, and *govern* data systems end-to-end.  
That’s why I structured this journey:

- Day 1–4: Schema design, SQL querying, joins and analytics  
- Day 5–6: Data integrity, indexing, views and window functions  
- Day 7–8: Backend logic (triggers/functions), transactions and concurrency  
- Day 9: Modern PostgreSQL features (JSONB, full-text search, UUIDs)  
- Day 10: Performance tuning, EXPLAIN plans and optimization  
- Day 11 (Bonus): Security, RLS, partitioning, procedures and production readiness  

### ✅ Skills I Bring  
- Strong PostgreSQL expertise: querying, schema design, performance tuning  
- Cloud & data infrastructure: Azure, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines  
- DevOps mindset: automation, monitoring, reliability, cost-efficiency  
- Developer-friendly: I write code, build platforms, publish technical articles  

### 📚 My Tech Story  
- Author at **Cloud Worrior** — where I publish on DevOps, cloud, data & platform patterns.  
- Experienced building cost-savvy cloud platforms and data services at scale.  
- Created this SQL portfolio as a public demonstration of deep, practical database skills — ideal for backend, data engineering and DevOps roles.
